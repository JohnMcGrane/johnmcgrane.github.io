Welcome!

My name is John Fox. I'm a recent masterâ€™s graduate interested in scientific computing, data analysis, and data visualization. I enjoy applying statistical thinking to problems and extracting insights from data. Currently I'm seeking employment where I can leverage my programming skills to advance data-driven decision making. In general, I'm a self-starter with great communication skills and a mindset tuned for problem solving.

In my spare time I enjoy mountain biking, nordic skiing, soccer, podcasts, reading, learning Spanish, and listening to music. I generally keep track of goings-on in the EPL, the NBA, and the UCI World Tour.
