Welcome!

My name is John Fox. I'm a recent masterâ€™s graduate interested in scientific computing, data analysis, and data visualization. I enjoy applying statistical thinking to complex problems and extracting insights from data. Currently I'm seeking employment where I can leverage my programming skills to advance data-driven decision making. In general, I'm a self-starter with great communication skills and a mindset tuned for problem solving. Please feel free to email me with any questions!
