In my spare time I enjoy mountain biking, nordic skiing, soccer, podcasts, reading, trivia, Spanish, and music. I generally keep track of goings-on in the EPL, the NBA, the UCI World Tour, and the UCI Mountain Bike World Cup.

People I find intriguing:
Moritz Thomsen
Abraham Verghese
Kílian Jornet
Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio
Mike Winkelmann
