Recent master’s graduate with 2+ years data analysis and visualization experience. Passionate about statistical thinking and extracting insights from data. Seeking to leverage programming skills to advance data-driven decision making. Self-starter with top communication skills and a mindset tuned for problem solving.

In my spare time I enjoy mountain biking, nordic skiing, fútbol, podcasts, reading, speaking Spanish, and listening to music. I generally keep track of goings-on in the EPL, the NBA, and the UCI World Tour.
